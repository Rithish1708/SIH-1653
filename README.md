## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
The **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) Workshop** is designed to help students understand the competition structure and problem statements. It guides participants on how to form an effective team with diverse skill sets to tackle real-world challenges. The workshop teaches problem-solving techniques and brainstorming methods to generate innovative ideas. Students learn about prototyping, UI/UX design, and minimum viable product (MVP) development to create impactful solutions. It introduces emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and blockchain to enhance projects and make them more efficient. Participants also receive training on pitching and presentation skills to showcase their ideas confidently. The workshop provides mentorship from industry experts and past winners to offer valuable insights and guidance. A mock hackathon is conducted to give students a real-time experience of the competition. This allows them to test their ideas, work under pressure, and collaborate effectively. Finally, constructive feedback is provided to help students refine their solutions before the final competition.

## Technology Stack
A technology stack is a combination of tools, frameworks, and programming languages used to develop a software solution. It consists of the front-end, back-end, database, and infrastructure layers. The front-end typically includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular for user interfaces. The back-end is powered by programming languages such as Python, Java, or Node.js, along with frameworks like Django, Spring Boot, or Express.js. Databases, either SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase), store and manage data efficiently. Cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud provide hosting, storage, and computing power. APIs enable seamless integration with third-party services and microservices architecture. DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines ensure smooth deployment and scalability. Security measures, including authentication, encryption, and firewalls, protect data and applications. Version control systems like Git and platforms such as GitHub or GitLab facilitate collaboration. A well-chosen technology stack ensures performance, scalability, and maintainability of the software solution.

## Dependencies
Dependencies refer to external libraries, frameworks, or tools required for a software project to function properly. They help developers save time by reusing existing solutions instead of building everything from scratch. Front-end dependencies include frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js, along with package managers like npm or Yarn. Back-end dependencies consist of frameworks such as Express.js, Django, or Spring Boot, as well as middleware and authentication tools. Database dependencies include ORM libraries like Sequelize, Hibernate, or SQLAlchemy for efficient data handling. API dependencies, such as Axios or Fetch, facilitate communication between services. DevOps dependencies include Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines for automation and deployment. Security dependencies involve encryption libraries, authentication modules, and vulnerability scanners. Testing dependencies include Jest, Mocha, Selenium, or JUnit for unit and integration testing. Managing dependencies properly ensures smooth development, compatibility, and maintainability. Dependency management tools like package managers and version control help prevent conflicts and streamline updates.
